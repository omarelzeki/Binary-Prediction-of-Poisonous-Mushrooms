# Wild Mushrooms Exploration and Neural Network Binary Prediction

## Overview

This project explores a dataset of wild mushrooms, aiming to classify them as edible or poisonous. We’ll perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), one-hot encoding, and build a neural network model using Python and Torch.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about various mushroom features, including cap shape, odor, gill color, etc. It’s available on Kaggle: [Wild Mushrooms Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e8/data).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- PyTorch

## Usage

- Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/omarelzeki/Binary-Prediction-of-Poisonous-Mushrooms.git  
```
- Run the Jupyter notebook:

` anyone-craving-wild-mushrooms-eda-ohe-nn.ipynb`


- Follow the notebook steps to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the neural network.
